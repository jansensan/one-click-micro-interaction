## Context

In the context of the [Interaction Models](https://academia.jansensan.net/category/30847/) course, professor [Roc Par√©s](https://www.dtic.upf.edu/~rpares/principal_EN.html) invited us to create a one-click micro-interaction media work.

## Instructions

1. Watch one of the following videos:
	- The BBC short documentary film [_Living in an Unreal World_](https://youtu.be/PtjfoEvsR9w) (2016), by [Adam Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis)
	- [_In My Language_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnylM1hI2jc) (2007), by [Amanda (Mei) Baggs](https://ballastexistenz.wordpress.com/about-2/)
2. Create a one single click interactive piece as a personal reaction to the chosen film.
3. You can use any authoring tool, application or environment as far as it can be installed in the "professor's computer" of our classroom and that it allows participants to interact with one single click.

### Restrictions

- No text (no text at all).
- No found photos nor stock photos (If you decide using photos please use your own photos).
- No clipart nor found images (If you decide to use still images make your own drawings).
- No found sound files nor commercially available music (if you choose to use sound, please make your own recordings).
- Same with video or other types of moving image.
- Your participant can experience your whole piece in only one click (strictly, one single click).
